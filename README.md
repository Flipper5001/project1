## Description
In the first project of the UWA Coding BootCamp, Filipe, May, Dan, and Vittorio have been tasked with working collaboratively in a group to create an application that solves a real world problem.

Once a problem has been identified and the app created, it is our job as a group to pitch our product to class mates and instructors as if it was a real world job scenario, thus setting us up for future success in the field.

## Key Points
Working in a group this time around means that the entirity of the site is not made by just one person, the duties are divided amongst the group. That being said, even though it was not mandatory to appoint a team lead, we unanamously agreed that Filipe was the best candidate to guide us through this body of work.

The early stages of developement consisted of our group of 4 bouncing ideas off each other and reviewing the acceptance criteria of the project, and streamling that in to what would become our final product.

## User Story
As someone who has come home after a long and tiring day of work, i want to get a recipe from ingredients that i have in my fridge without having to go shopping, so that i can solve my hunger issues.

## Skills Used
After deciding what issue we were to solve, the wireframing begun;

After a group effort of designing the layout, the next step was the create a New Project on Github, with this being done, we now have access to a job board to create and deligate tasks to everyone involved.

After using the CSS framework Bootstrap in class we had to determine which alternative one we would use. After a bit of searching around and reading a bunch of documentation we decided on using Foundation CSS.

Two server-side API's are to be implemented, we scoured what food and meal API's were about and which one best suited our needs, it was determined that the popular Spoonacular API would be the way forward as it allowed us, for free, to search multiple ingrediants. Our thought process changed partially in terms of what second API was to be used. In the end, who doesn't want to settle in with a nice movie at the end of the day? A suggestion of 4 movies with the underlying theme of food will be displayed to the user to help kickstart their evening of food and entertainment!

We use client side storage to store previous searches and display them as a button.

The site as a whole has a responsive design for desktop and mobile applications, as well as have a good looking polished user interface.
